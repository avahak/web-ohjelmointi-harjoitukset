(ChatGPT 3.5 on secure way of handling user submitted data with php and sql:)

When handling user-submitted data in PHP, HTML, and SQL, it's crucial to follow secure practices 
to protect both your application and user information.

**Storing User Data in SQL:**

When storing user-submitted data in an SQL database, avoid directly including it in SQL statements. 
Instead, use prepared statements with placeholders 
and bind the user data to these placeholders using `bind_param`. For example:

```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO table (txt_column) VALUES (?)");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $user_text);
$stmt->execute();
```

This approach prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensures the integrity of your database.

**Displaying User Data in HTML:**

When displaying user data on a webpage, do not directly output it in HTML, as it can 
lead to display issues and security risks like XSS attacks. Use `htmlspecialchars` 
to sanitize the user data before displaying it. For example:

```php
echo "<p>User data: " . htmlspecialchars($user_text) . "</p>";
```

`htmlspecialchars` escapes HTML tags and special characters, ensuring that the user's input is 
treated as content only and not as potentially harmful code.

By following these practices, you can safely handle user-submitted data in your 
PHP, HTML, and SQL applications, protecting both your application's security and 
the integrity of your user data.
